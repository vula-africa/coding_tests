# Vula Technical Challenge Submission

Hi there,

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this technical challenge. It was an enjoyable and well-rounded set of tasks.

Below you will find my solutions for the three challenges. Each solution is contained within its own directory, and I have recorded a short Loom video for each one to walk through my thought process and implementation details.

### 1. Batch Processing (`batch_processing`)

This folder contains my Node.js + TypeScript solution for the batch processing function. The README inside provides instructions on how to install dependencies and run the code.
