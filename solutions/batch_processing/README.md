# Batch Processing Function

This directory contains the Node.js + TypeScript solution for the batch processing challenge.

The core logic is in `batchProcessor.ts`, which exports a `processApplications` function. A test script, `main.ts`, is included to demonstrate the function's usage with sample data.

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Execute the Test Script:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx ts-node main.ts
    ```

You will see the summary output for the sample batch and an empty batch printed to the console.
